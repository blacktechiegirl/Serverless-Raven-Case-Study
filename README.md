# The-Serverless-Raven-Case-Study
On the 3rd of october in year 2000, the serverless community in the central city of New jersey held a serverless meetup where they discussed several pressing serverless issues.
One of their major concerns was having a centralized platform where they could have all discussions pertaining to serverless and all its services.They came to a conclusion to build a serverless social media platform using 100% serverless services. The community was excited for this new project.
