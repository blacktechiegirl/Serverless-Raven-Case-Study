# The-Serverless-Raven-Case-Study
On the 3rd of october in year 2000, the serverless community in the central city of New jersey held a serverless meetup where they discussed several pressing serverless issues.
One of their major concerns was having a centralized platform where they could have all discussions pertaining to serverless and all its services.They came to a conclusion to build a serverless social media platform using 100% serverless services. The community was excited for this new project.

Tom Jefferson, the serverless community lead reached out to serverless architect Toyosi for her expertise in building reliable, secure and well architected serverless applications.

# The-Serverless-Raven-Challenge
Toyosi needs to build a highly reliable serverless platform that allows for the following actions
1. Each User should be able to create,update, read and delete their profile.
2. Each user should be able to create, read, update and delete their posts.
3. Each user should be able to create, read and delete their comments on any post.
4. Each serverless service should have its own page for discussions.
